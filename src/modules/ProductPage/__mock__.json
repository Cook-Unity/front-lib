It is also used to treat mild stomach upset, to reduce pain of osteoarthritis, and may even be used in heart disease and nasal allergies.

Also recognized as ascorbic acid, it is mostly known because of its antioxidant properties, but it also helps in the synthesis of collagen (growth and repair of connective tissue), the healing of wounds, and the functioning of the immune system. Vitamin C is also very important in a vegetarian diet as it helps absorb the iron in plant-based foods. Half a cup of lemon juice covers approximately a 77% of vitamin´s C daily recommendation. ",

My only complaint is that it felt like it was missing a carb, and the portion was too small.  Fortunately, I ate this at home so I was able to easily resolve these issues by making some rice in my rice cooker.  Including the rice I made, this was my favorite of the 9 different meals that I ordered.  It didn't take much effort and it was preferable to other meals I got that had no vegetables since making rice doesn't require any fresh ingredients, but it's mildly annoying that I had to do it.\n\nHere is my full ranking:\nBeef bibimbap\nSautéed gulf hake (+$3)\nRoasted Faroe island salmon (+$3)\nJerk lamb meat balls\nBulgogi ramen\nRoasted salmon with pineapple fried\nLamb kebab turmeric hummus\nRosemary chicken thigh\nSlow roasted Cornish hen\n\nMy profile:\nMale, mid 20s, average height, slim build, harsh rater, moderately active, values tasty and balanced meals with protein, vegetables, and carbs.",
