        'This member of the mint family has been used as a medicinal plant, and its oils and extracts are said to have antioxidant and antibacterial properties. Fragrant fresh basil, for instance, offers a healthy dose of blood-clotting vitamin K -- 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh basil provide 27% of the RDA -- as well as vitamin A, manganese, and magnesium. (You can find more vitamin K in green leafy veggies such as cabbage, cauliflower, kale, and spinach -- but talk to your doctor if you’re taking a blood thinner such as warfarin; you don’t want too much or too little K.',
